# CS180Team-Project
Every team needs to implement some form of user profile, a way to search for users, a way to view users, and a way to add, remove, and block friends. Each team can then choose to implement either a news feed or a direct messaging system. 

Role 1: Project lead, interface designer, interface test cases.
Role 2: Develop database objects and test cases.
Role 3: Develop methods and application control flow.
Role 4: Develop log in details and user permissions. 
Role 5: Develop data persistence solutions and test cases. 

The first phase of the project consists of building the entire database side of the project including interfaces and test cases. Forward thinking is strongly encouraged. Questions such as: What are we storing? How are we accessing it? What are we calculating? All should be addressed during this stage. Project 3 was an example of a database. HW10 covers techniques on how to make the database thread safe. Remember the database will only be interacting with a single server; however, that server will be interacting with multiple clients simultaneously. A README.txt file is required with each phase and should be submitted in the Vocareum workspace alongside any java files. See documentation bellow.
